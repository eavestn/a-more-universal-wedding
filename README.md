**Gathering**

_The Celebrant says_ **F**riends, we, NN., come together to witness the joining together of this [_man_] and
this [_woman_] - the union of [_husband and wife_] in heart, body, and mind. Today, 
they marry for their joy; for the help and comfort given one another in 
prosperity and adversity. Marriage, therefore, is not to be entered into 
unadvisedly or lightly, but reverently and deliberately. And it is for this reason that we
gather today.

**The Declaration of Consent**

_The Celebrant says to the [woman]_

N., will you have this [man] to be your [husband]; to live
together in the covenant of marriage? Will you love him,
comfort him, honor and keep him, in sickness and in health;
and, forsaking all others, be faithful to him as long as you
both shall live?

_The [Woman] answers_

I will.

_The Celebrant says to the [man]_

N., will you have this [woman] to be your [wife]; to live
together in the covenant of marriage? Will you love her,
comfort her, honor and keep her, in sickness and in health;
and, forsaking all others, be faithful to her as long as you
both shall live?

_The [Man] answers_

I will.

_The Celebrant then addresses the witnesses saying_

Will all of you witnessing these promises do all in your
power to uphold these two persons in their marriage?

_People_

We Will.

**The Marriage**

_The [Man], facing the [woman] and taking [her] right hand in [his], says_

I, N., take you, N., to be my wife, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better for worse,
for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to
cherish, until we are parted by death. This is my solemn vow.

_Then they loose their hands, and the [Woman], still facing the [man], takes
[his] right hand in [hers], and says_

I, N., take you, N., to be my husband,
to have and to hold from this day forward, for better for
worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love
and to cherish, until we are parted by death. This is my
solemn vow.

_They loose their hands._

_The Celebrant may ask to bless each ring or rings as follows_

May this ring forever be a sign of the vows by which
this man and this woman have bound themselves to each
other. _So be it_.

**Reading**

_Both [Man] and [Woman] will respectively read, in turn, their chosen readings._

**The Exchange of Rings**

_The giver places the ring on the ring-finger of the other's hand and says_

N., I give you this ring as a symbol of my vow, and with all
that I am, and all that I have, I honor you.

_Then the Celebrant joins the right hands of [husband and wife] and says_

Now that N. and N. have given themselves to each other by
solemn vows, with the joining of hands and the giving and
receiving of a ring, I pronounce that they are husband
and wife.

Those whose paths have collided inextricably, let no one put asunder.

_People_	

So be it.
