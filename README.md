## A Marriage

### Gathering

_The Celebrant says_ 

**F**riends, we, NN., come together to witness the joining together of this [_man_] and
this [_woman_] - the union of [_husband and wife_] in heart, body, and mind. Today, 
they marry for their joy; for the help and comfort given one another in 
prosperity and adversity. Marriage, therefore, is not to be entered into 
unadvisedly or lightly, but reverently and deliberately. And it is for this reason that we
gather today.

### The Declaration of Consent

_The Celebrant says to the [woman]_

N., will you have this [man] to be your [husband]; to live
together in the covenant of marriage? Will you love him,
comfort him, honor and keep him, in sickness and in health;
and, forsaking all others, be faithful to him as long as you
both shall live?

_The [Woman] answers_

I will.

_The Celebrant says to the [man]_

N., will you have this [woman] to be your [wife]; to live
together in the covenant of marriage? Will you love her,
comfort her, honor and keep her, in sickness and in health;
and, forsaking all others, be faithful to her as long as you
both shall live?

_The [Man] answers_

I will.

_The Celebrant then addresses the witnesses saying_

Will all of you witnessing these promises do all in your
power to uphold these two persons in their marriage?

_People_

We Will.

### The Marriage

_The [Man], facing the [woman] and taking [her] right hand in [his], says_

I, N., take you, N., to be my wife, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better for worse,
for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to
cherish, until we are parted by death. This is my solemn vow.

_Then they loose their hands, and the [Woman], still facing the [man], takes
[his] right hand in [hers], and says_

I, N., take you, N., to be my husband,
to have and to hold from this day forward, for better for
worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love
and to cherish, until we are parted by death. This is my
solemn vow.

_They loose their hands._

_The Celebrant may ask to bless each ring or rings as follows_

May this ring forever be a sign of the vows by which
this man and this woman have bound themselves to each
other. _So be it_.

#### The Readings

_Both [Man] and [Woman] will respectively read, in turn, their chosen readings._

#### The Exchange of Rings

_The giver places the ring on the ring-finger of the other's hand and says_

N., I give you this ring as a symbol of my vow, and with all
that I am, and all that I have, I honor you.

_Then the Celebrant joins the right hands of [husband and wife] and says_

Now that N. and N. have given themselves to each other by
solemn vows, with the joining of hands and the giving and
receiving of a ring, I pronounce that they are husband
and wife.

Those whose paths have collided inextricably, let no one put asunder.

_People_	

So be it.

### The First Blessing

_The Celebrant says_

Let us be of one mind.

Look with favor upon the world and especially upon this man and this woman whom we
make one. _So be it_.

Give them wisdom and devotion in the ordering of their
common life, that each may be to the other a strength in need, a
counselor in perplexity, a comfort in sorrow, and a companion
in joy. _So be it_.

Grant that their wills may be so knit together that they may grow in love
and peace with one another all the days of their life. _So be it_.

Give them grace, when they hurt each other, to recognize and
acknowledge their fault, and to seek each other's forgiveness. _So be it_.

Make their life together a sign of love to this broken world, that unity may overcome estrangement,
forgiveness heal guilt, and joy conquer despair. _So be it_.

Give them such fulfillment of their mutual affection that they
may reach out in love and concern for others. _So be it_.

Grant that all married persons who have witnessed these
vows may find their lives strengthened and their loyalties
confirmed. _So be it_.

#### The Second Blessing

_The people remain standing. The husband and wife join hands, and the Celebrant
says one of the following_

Pour out the abundance of blessings upon this
man and this woman. Defend them from every enemy. Lead
them into all peace. Let their love for each other be a seal
upon their hearts, a mantle about their shoulders, and a
crown upon their foreheads. Keep them in their work and in
their companionship; in their sleeping and in their waking; in
their joys and in their sorrows; in their life and in their death. _So be it_.

_or this_

Bless this man and this womanthat they may so love, honor, and cherish each other
in faithfulness and patience and in wisdom,
that their home may be a haven of blessing and peace. _So be it_.

_The husband and wife still kneeling, the Celebrant adds_

Let the World keep you; favor you; and fill you with all spiritual benediction and
grace; that you may faithfully live together in this life, and -
in the age to come - have life everlasting. _So be it_.
